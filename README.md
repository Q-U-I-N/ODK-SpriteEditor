# ODK-SpriteEditor


A sprite editor using the ODK-SpriteLib

This was made with just learning in mind. No profit or copyright infringement intended.


I'm making this code public for those looking to study it.
It's likely that I won't continue developing it, but who knows?

* Edit/Create SPK, ISPK, ASPK, SSPK
* Send sprites from one pack to the other
* Import images as sprites
* Export sprites as images
* SPK supports empty pixels
* ISPK supports color key.


One of the DarkEden projects i'm most proud of. Almost complete.
